# Machine_learning

In this repository you will find the path I took to learn Machine Learning.  This was a process of around two years where I learned not only how to write the code behind this enormous and exciting world of artificial intelligence, but also the mathematics on which the technology is based, which every day ceases to be a science fiction dream to become an everyday tool.  As you can see, it is divided into 4 folders where each one represents one of the current methods of autonomous learning.

 - Math: This is where you can find different projects in order to understand mathematics, probability, statistics and the tools to visualize the data. ![](https://i.imgur.com/P6a4rGs.png)
 
 - Supervised Learning: This directory is where you can find most how does it owrks the DNN, CNN, RNN, Transformers, encoders, decoders and more.  You can also see how to use them for stock market prediction, image identification and object creation.![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/1HzrUhV.png)
 
 - Unsupervaised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, which is an important mode of learning in people, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it.![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/6ZaELWr.png)
 
 - Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/9siuaLL.png)
